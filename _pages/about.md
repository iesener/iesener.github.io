I study political violence, international conflict and security, and quantitative research methodology. My research interests include activist-militant relations, radicalization, militant propaganda, public support for militancy, state repression and violence, and international influences on civil conflict.

My research examines the coexistence of militant organizations and activist groups within dissident movements. It investigates how activist actions influence the support for militancy and how state actions factor into the determinants of movement support. A second branch of my research explores the various forms of militant propaganda, examining the tactical and strategic reasons behind changes in militant rhetoric. Another set of my projects analyze how international actors and institutions can influence the likelihood and dynamics of civil war. I use experimental, quasi-experimental and observational designs as well as text-as-data methods in my projects. 

My solo research has been published in the <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em> and revised and resubmitted to the <em>American Journal of Political Science.</em> My research is supported by the <a href="https://wc.wustl.edu/">Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy</a> at Washington University in St. Louis. I am affiliated with the <a href="https://dapp-lab.org/">Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project</a>.

I am a College Fellow at Harvard University Government Department. I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis in May 2024. You can contact me at <isener@fas.harvard.edu>.
