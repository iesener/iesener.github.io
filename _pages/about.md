I study International Relations with a focus on political violence in the Middle East. My research looks at the ways the microdynamics of civil war are connected to the international system of which they are a part.


I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Student at Washington University in St. Louis. I earned my M.A. in Political Science from Sabancı University and B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from Boğaziçi University. You can contact me at <isener@wustl.edu>.
