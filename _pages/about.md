I study International Relations with a focus on political violence in the Middle East. My research looks at the ways the microdynamics of civil war are connected to the international system of which they are a part. 

My dissertation focuses on rebel movements that develop both legal and armed wings, how individuals decide which wing to join, and what states and rebel movements can do to influence individuals' choice. My previous research looked at the consequences of excluding civil war belligerents from peace negotiations organized to resolve a civil war focusing on the case of the Syrian Civil War. My research interests include armed group behavior, civil war, and militancy recruitment.

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Washington University in St. Louis. I earned my M.A. in Political Science from Sabancı University and B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from Boğaziçi University. You can contact me at <isener@wustl.edu>.
