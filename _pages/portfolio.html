<h2>Activism or Militancy? State Oppression and Rebel Propaganda Influence on the Type of Participation <font color="gray">(Dissertation Project)</font></h2>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
I explore rebel movement sympathizers' calculus in the choice between joining the movement as an activist or a militant. In addition to the widely discussed material costs and benefits of participation, individuals face differing levels of non-material benefits and social and legal punishment costs, the latter being an essential part of their decision to choose militancy over activism. Next, I present the ways the government and the rebel movement can alter individuals' calculus. Using oppression, Governments can increase the cost of participating in a rebel group. Using emotional propaganda, rebel groups can increase the non-material benefits of participation. To test these expectations, I use a survey design conducted in Southeast Turkey where there has been significant involvement with the rebel movement PKK.

<h2>Peace Negotiations and Civilian Targeting</h2>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Does the participation of armed actors in peace talks influence their strategy of targeting civilians? I argue that before peace talks belligerents have incentives to demonstrate their military strength and respect for humanitarian standards to international third parties. Thus, they are more likely to spare civilians and discriminately target enemy combatants before international talks. Using change point analysis and surrogate data testing on the daily casualty and territorial control data for the Syrian Civil War, I show that belligerents engaged in negotiations incite more combatant and fewer civilian casualties in the enemy territory immediately before an international meeting is to be held. These findings underscore that international parties can drive combatants to avoid violence against civilians by inviting them to peace talks.

<h2>Does UN Peacekeeping Protect Civilians? <font color="gray">(with William G. Nomikos and Rob Williams)</font></h2>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  Research in political science has shown that UN peacekeeping operations are an important tool for ending civil war violence. However, much less is known about how UN peacekeepers affect civilian victimization. Given that civilians bear the primary costs of intrastate conflict,  understanding how international actors can contribute to the resolution of violence affecting them is a pressing concern. How does the presence of UN peacekeepers affect civilian victimization? We address this question by offering a straightforward empirical test of how UN peacekeeping patrols affect the likelihood that there will be violence against civilians. We build on the existing literature and established practices of peacekeeping to argue that peacekeepers deter violence against violence. To test our argument, we examine the case of Mail, the site of large-scale communal violence managed by UN peacekeepers since  2013. We employ a Geographic Regression Discontinuity Design (GRDD) around the border of Mali and Burkina Faso to estimate the causal effect of deploying peacekeepers to an area with growing communal tensions. Ultimately, our research provides robust causal evidence that UN peacekeeping works at the local level to protect civilians.

<h2>Strike When they Aren't Looking: Great Power Crises and Threats to Rule <font color="gray">(with David Carter)</font></h2>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  Although regime threats such as civil conflict and coup d'etat are widely studied, their systemic links to global crises receive relatively little attention. We argue that episodes of instability among great powers ripples through the international system and foments violent threats to rule in less powerful states. During periods of systemic stability, great powers actively maintain influence over allied political factions in states within their sphere of influence, providing financial and security assistance. When great powers experience instability and crisis, they reduce engagement in the internal politics of less powerful states, which provides an opening for violent challenges from regime opponents. We assess our arguments with both new and existing indicators of systemic instability, showing that periods of economic and security instability among great powers are associated with a heightened risk of both civil conflict onset and regime change coup attempts in smaller states. Our work offers a novel explanation for the emergence of threats to rule, integrating the literatures on great power politics, civil conflict and coup d'etat, while also demonstrating why regime threats not only cluster geographically but also cluster in time.

<h2>The Impact of Court Packing on Turkish Constitutional Court Decisions</h2>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  Using an original and comprehensive dataset, I measure Turkish Constitutional Court justices' ideal points in a two dimensional ideology space. I show that justices' ideologies and background characteristics are significant determinants of their votes and dissents in annulment action cases between 2002 and 2016. The more restrainist and liberal a justice is, the more likely they will vote for the unconstitutionality of AKP legislation. The main question this study seeks to answer is whether the impact of justices' ideologies on their votes has been significantly different after the act of court packing in 2010. The analyses show that the probability of voting for the unconstitutionality of AKP legislation between 2010 and 2016 is significantly lower than the cases between 2002 and 2010.
