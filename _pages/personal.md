## I grew up in Samsun, Turkey

I grew up in Samsun, a small Turkish city on the shores of the Black Sea. The picture above shows my hometown's beautiful coastline.

My great grandparents lived in different parts of the Eastern Balkans. After mübadele, the population exchange between Grece and Turkey, they were placed to Samsun's mountainous villages shown above. Parts of my greater family still live here.

## I graduated from Boğaziçi University with a BA

Boğaziçi is famously one of the most welcoming campuses for street cats. My dormitory life there was characterized by sharing all residential spaces with these cats, the true owners of the campus. Less importantly, the campus also has a breathtaking view of the Bosphorus.


## I was a McDonnell International Scholars Academy Scholar at WashU
