## I am a McDonnell International Scholars Academy Scholar

<br/><img src='/images/mcdonnell.jpeg'>

[McDonnell Academy](https://mcdonnell.wustl.edu) brings together a multinational and multidisciplinary graduate student body. This picture is from the annual reception in 2019 when we welcomed new scholars to the program.

## I am a member of WashU Grad and Undergrad Workers Union

<br/><img src='/images/wugwu.jpg'>

[WashU Grad and Undergrad Workers Union](https://wugwu.org) is a student union that aims to improve the working conditions of all campus workers at WashU. The picture above is taken the last day of a month-long campaign that aimed to increase the minimum wage to \$15/hr for all campus workers. Soon after the end of this campaign, Chancellor Andrew Martin [announced](https://andrewdmartin.wustl.edu/minimum-wage/) that they will be increasing minimum hourly wage to \$15/hour for _non-student_ workers. WUGWU is still addressing campus workers' needs such as the need for childcare and broader healthcare benefits.
