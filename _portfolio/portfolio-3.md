  Although the causes of civil wars have been studied on individual, organizational and state levels, their systemic links to global crises have largely been neglected. We argue that the instability great powers go through increases the likelihood of violent turmoil in allied countries. In times of systemic instability, global powersâ€™ authority over the political divisions i n the countries within their sphere of influence weakens. This weakening opens up venues for the empowerment of the violent opposition, leading to a civil war. Our theory is supported by a set of indicators for systemic instability including economic, military, intelligence and material indicators. We further test the mechanisms of this link by showing that great powers in crisis lose influence in allied countries. Our work offers a novel explanation for civil war which can explain the abundance of civil war onsets in 1970s, 1990s and 2010s.
