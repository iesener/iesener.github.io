title: "The Impact of Court Packing on Turkish Constitutional Court Decisions"
excerpt: "Using an original and comprehensive dataset, I measure Turkish Constitutional Court justices' ideal points in a two dimensional ideology space. I show that justices' ideologies and background characteristics are significant determinants of their votes and dissents in annulment action cases between 2002 and 2016. The more restrainist and liberal a justice is, the more likely they will vote for the unconstitutionality of AKP legislation. The main question this study seeks to answer is whether the impact of justices' ideologies on their votes has been significantly different after the act of court packing in 2010. The analyses show that the probability of voting for the unconstitutionality of AKP legislation between 2010 and 2016 is significantly lower than the cases between 2002 and 2010."

With the 2010 Constitutional Amendment, the structure, duties, and authorities of the Constitutional Court have been rearranged. The three main changes have been the composition of the Court, the tenure of justices, and the scope of the applications to the Court.



### Table 1: The Change in the Composition of the Constitutional Court

Table 1 summarizes the composition of the Court as it is prescribed in 1982 Constitution before and after the 2010 Amendment. The Amendment decreased the portion of members who are elected from among the higher courts (military courts, most importantly), while increased the portion of members elected from among other legal experts (teaching staff in higher education, for example). The new design allowed the Court to be more open to civilian (i.e. non-judicial body) influence, and this fact attracted substantial support from independent liberal democrats, and major [European institutions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11279881) such as the European Union, Venice Commission, and Council of Europe. However, with the AKP holding the majority of the parliament and the president being a former party member, the civilian influence had to be subject to one and only filter. 


### Figure 1: Change in the Median and Mean Justices' Ideological Positioning

Previous literature considers the political space in Turkey to be two-dimensional. Liberal-conservative dimension stands for justices' tendency to favor conservative governments' legislation. The second dimension captures individual justices' tendency to favor state ideology, or military-bureaucratic elites' interest. Figure 1 illustrates the annual change in the median and mean justices' ideological positioning from 1985 to 2016. Since the ideology scores are static, these changes are a result of incoming personnel, not a result of justices varying positions.
